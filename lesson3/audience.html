        <h1>Target Audience</h1>
        <p>The target audience will include young adults, married or single, who may also have young 
            children, these individuals lead active lives and enjoy various activities indoors and 
            outdoors. 
            <br>
            <br>
            One example of an individual who would visit the site is a woman in her 30’s with 2 children 
            between 5 and 10. School is out for the summer and they live in an area where it frequently 
            rains. This consumer would visit the site to check the weather for the next week and check 
            for ideas of things for her kids to do either indoors or outdoors.
            <br>
            <br>
            Another consumer example would be a young man who is organizing a large outside event for 
            friends and the community. He needs to monitor the weather for the next two weeks leading 
            up to the even to determine if the back-up venue for his event will be required. </p>
